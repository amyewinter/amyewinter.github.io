        <summary><h1>Amy's Reflections</h1></summary>
        <p>A fascinating subtext of Atul Gawande's <i>Checklist Manifesto</i> is its reflection on social hierarchy. After discussing how the construction industry manages complexity through structured and fairly democratic communication practices, Gawande claims that autonomy has been axiomatic in the medical profession and observes that the result is a "disaster" of "incompatible decisions and overlooked errors." A further implication of his discussion is that, when properly applied, checklists can inherently challenge power and status hierarchies in professional settings. If true, could this be one answer to Dr Newmark's question about not using them in teaching settings, in which an "expert" imparts knowledge as  Master Builders once did in construction? </p>
        <p>When Aidan Bryant implies that she has to "brand" herself, and says that 30% of her job is getting "buy-in" from her team, is she describing a situation where the team values everyone's input, or one where some members have to convince those in charge? In the instruction set assignment, I reflected on my failure to advocate for user testing as the only female member of my IT department. Even though I believed testing would benefit our product, I didn't have the energy for the kind of "endless, circular religious" design debate Steve Krug described in Chapter 8 of <i>Don't Make Me Think</i>. Gawande's examples of successful application of checklists correlate nicely with Krug's prescription for ending the "religious debates": "…the collective skill, experience, creativity and common sense of the team…" </p>
        <p>What has your experience in teams been like? Could you be open-minded, inquisitive, and curious? Did your colleagues express those qualities toward you? Were your skill, experience, creativity and common sense respected? Or was there a formal or unspoken hierarchy which influenced your contributions? Was anyone so status-conscious and fragile they couldn't bear a challenge, even to save a life?  (Was that person you?) Did the behavior of the team members reinforce existing systems of power, or create an environment in which everyone's expertise was respected and welcomed? </p>
