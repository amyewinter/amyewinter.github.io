        <h1>Usability/UCD Testing Report</h1>
        <h2>Student Forms, UNM Office of the Registrar</h2>
        <p>By Amy E. Winter, MPA</p>
            <hr />

        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>An exploratory usability study of the Student Forms page on registrar.unm.edu was conducted in November 2025 by Amy Winter. The study was designed to determine XXX  Study participants were fellow students in ENGL 502 in the fall semester, 2025.</p>
        <p>During the test sessions, participants were given the same task and were asked to “think out loud” to help clarify the motivations for their actions during the test. After the test, participants responded to additional questions designed to elicit their opinions about the site. Overall, the participants XX  </p>
        <p>An overview of the results from the study follows, with recommended changes for areas of the site where participants encountered difficulty. Additional testing is recommended to XXX</p>
        <h3>Audience Analysis</h3>
        <p>The primary audience for the Student Forms page is UNM students. </p>
        <p>Secondary audience includes the group of people who might provide assistance to students encountering difficulties with the forms: student advisors and other UNM staff and faculty, and family members and friends of students.</p>

		<p>UNM's Office of Institutional Analytics provides the following data about the student body for the 2024-2025 academic year:</p>
		<figure>
					<img src="/images/gender-degrees-oia-unm.jpg">
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<img src="/images/ethnicity-oia-unm.jpg">
		</figure>

        <p>The student body is quite diverse in ethnicity. Though student age data is not provided, both identified audiences likely encompass a wide variety of ages (though a significant proportion of undergraduate students is probably Gen Z). The audiences are also likely to diverge widely with regard to nationality, native language, education level, socioeconomic background, and life and work experience.  </p>
        <p>In its marketing, UNM identifies being a Hispanic-serving institution and focusing on first-generation students as important characteristics. These audience segments present particular needs and barriers which could complicate their interaction with the Student Forms page and forms as currently presented.  For example, first-generation students don't always have a family member who understands the mundane details of college attendance like navigating registration requirements. Students whose family members don't read English might also have difficulty getting support to complete complex forms.</p>
        <p>In analyzing audience needs and potential problems with the Student Forms page and forms process, I am relying on Schriver's intuition-driven method, by which "a writer's experience with audience and texts will result in an improved product because the imagined audience in the writer's head will guide decisions made about the final product." I am relying on my years of experience with web development and UNM systems and processes as well as the results of user testing, to help guide recommendations for improvements to the Student Forms page and forms process.</p>
		<p>In terms of identifying a shared "personal culture" for such diverse audiences, I could hypothesize that students and/or their helpers value education, and they want to follow rules and solve problems, since they are motivated to understand university regulations and processes and complete a required form to support the student's success (as opposed to ignoring the student's problem or giving up on trying to solve it). This may seem obvious, but the tone of the registrar's pages and forms (and UNM's websites more broadly) is often bureaucratic at best and oppositional at worst, sometimes almost working against audience members instead of with them. Language that is more welcoming, acknowledging the user's desire to comply with university regulations, might create a friendlier, more engaging experience which could even influence the user's opinion of the university as a whole.</p>
        <p>Given that a higher percentage of the audience may be teens, with little to no formal work experience, who may or may not have trusted adults who can provide assistance, it makes sense to design the experience to serve the lowest level of usability. Simplifying form language and interfaces will help seasoned users as well as novices complete their task successfully without additional guidance.</p>
		        <h3>Purpose and goals of test</h3>
                <p>I will analyze the design of the forms landing page and the user journey to completing the Demographic Information Change form, and make recommendations for improvements to the design, user experience, language and accessibility of the page and all its linked forms, using the Demographic Information Change form as an example. An an attempt will be made to identify potential internal obstacles to achieving those recommendations.</p>
       <ul>
           <li>
               Determine whether participants can find, and understand how to complete, a form on the <a href="https://registrar.unm.edu/forms/index.html">Student Forms page</a> of the UNM Registrar's Office
           </li>
           <li>Understand obstacles encountered by users</li>
           <li>Identify recommendations for improving the user experience and usability of the site</li>
       </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>
<p>Remote moderated testing will be performed with three testers, asking them to think aloud as they proceed through the test session. The test will incorporate some aspects of formative testing in that it will have a small sample size. The moderator will identify and note problems encountered by the test participants. Because the product is live and in use, however, the test will also have summative aspects, in that one goal is to determine whether the design and information architecture of the site successfully communicate information the target audience is seeking, and facilitate the completion of the task the user arrived at the site to accomplish. </p>

		        <h3>Participant recruitment</h3>
        <p>Testers are classmates assigned to the project; therefore, formal recruitment is not needed. There is no option to select testers based on demographic characteristics or assure the testers are representative of the identified audience for the product. Certain demographic information was collected and is shown below.</p>

		        <h3>Test scenario and task</h3>
        <p>The following scenario will be read to the participants before presenting the predefined, specific, open-ended task:</p>
           <p>“Imagine you are a UNM student whose name has changed. You were directed to this page when you asked how to officially change the name the University has on record for you.”</p>
           <p>Each participant will receive this task to complete.</p>
           <p>“Please talk through the steps, as you are executing them, to complete the task of changing your name on official university records. Since the site is live, please do not actually complete the task, but indicate what steps you would take if you needed to complete it.”</p>

        <h3>Test location, environment and equipment</h3>
        <p>Participants used the device and web browser of their choice to conduct the test. One test was conducted in person in my home office in Albuquerque. Two tests were conducted online via Zoom and participants were asked to share their screens. All tests were recorded using audio and/or video and were transcribed using the Office 365 MS Word Transcribe feature. The testing script was adapted from Steve Krug’s Sample Test Script (Krug, 2010).</p>

		<h3>Test length</h3>
		<p>The test sessions lasted 20-30 minutes each.</p>

		<h3>Test moderator role</h3>
		<p>To help counteract the potential moderator bias identified by Marsh (2022) and Spool et al (2008), the following will be attempted: </p>
		<ul>
			
		</ul>


        <h3>Participant characteristics</h3>
         <p>In total, 3 individuals participated in the study.</p>
		<hr/>

            <tr><td>Graduate student</td><td>2</td></tr>
           <tr><td>None</td></td><td>1</td></tr>
        </table>
  
            <h3>Quantitative Usability Metrics</h3>
		<h4>Participant difficulty rating</h4>
		<p>Participants were asked to rate the difficulty of completing the task using the following rating scale:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Not difficult at all</li>
			<li>Moderately difficult</li>
			<li>Very difficult</li>
		</ol>	<hr/>
		<h4>Participant confidence rating</h4>
		<p>Participants were asked to rate their confidence in completing the task, had they been attempting it in real life, using the following rating scale:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Not at all confident</li>
			<li>Moderately confident</li>
			<li>Very confident</li>
		</ol>	<hr/>
		<h4>Moderator completion rating</h4>
		<p>The task will be rated successfully completed if the participant:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Locates and views the Demographic Change Form online version</li>
			<li>Notices that they need to also download and then upload the PDF version</li>
			<li>Can point out where they would upload the form if they needed to complete it later</li>
		</ul>
		<p>at any point during the test, with or without moderator assistance or a reminder of the task instructions.</p>

        <h3>Qualitative Measures</h3>
		<p>Moderator observations and participant comments will be collected to address the following research questions.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Who do participants identify as the target audience for the site?</li>
			<li>What obstacles do participants encounter in locating the correct form?</li>
			<li>What obstacles do participants identify in understanding how to properly complete the form?</li>
			<li>What recommendations do participants have for improving the design, content, organization, function, and user journey of the pages and forms evaluated?</li>
		</ul>

			<li>Mobile first</li>
			<li>Clear content hierarchy</li>
			<li>Fast, reliable performance</li>
			<li>Multiple ways to access the same service</li>
		</ul>
<h4>AI Statement</h4>
        <p>Artificial intelligence resources were not used in the performance of this test, analysis of data, or preparation of the test plan or report, except for AI Overviews presented at the top of Google search engine result pages. </p>
