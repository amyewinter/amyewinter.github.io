        <h2>Usability/UCD Testing Report</h2>
        <h3>Student Forms, UNM Office of the Registrar</h3>

        <h4>Executive Summary</h4>
        <p>An exploratory usability study of the Student Forms page on registrar.unm.edu was conducted in November 2025 by Amy Winter. The study was designed to determine XXX  Study participants were fellow students in ENGL 502 in the fall semester, 2025.</p>
        <p>During the test sessions, participants were given the task XXXXX . All were asked to “think out loud” to help clarify the motivations for their actions during the test. After the test, participants responded to additional questions designed to elicit their opinions about the site. Overall, the participants XX  </p>
        <p>An overview of the results from the study follows, with recommended changes for areas of the site where participants encountered difficulty. Additional testing is recommended to XXX</p>
        <h4>Audience Analysis</h4>
        <p>The primary audience for the Student Forms page is UNM students. </p>
        <p>Secondary audiences include </p>
        <p>These are broad nonspecialist audiences with many subsets, and there will be real challenges in designing a user experience that meets their needs. According to Bettes, "Audience analysis can become complicated when you consider that you may have a combination of audience types and backgrounds: mixed audience types, wide variability within audience, and/or unknown audiences."  She continues, "If you write to the lowest common denominator of reader, you are likely to end up with a cumbersome, tedious, book-like report that will turn off the majority of readers. However, if you do not write to that lowest level, you lose that segment of readers."</p>
        <p>UNM's student body encompasses a wide variety of ages (though a significant proportion is likely to be Gen Z), nationalities, ethnicities, native languages, education levels, socioeconomic backgrounds, and life and work experience. The group of people who might provide assistance to students encountering difficulties with the forms is similarly diverse and difficult to characterize. The statement from Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca (quoted by Blakeslee) that "knowing an audience with certainty is impossible" is relevant and reassuring for this concern.</p>
        <p>In its marketing, UNM identifies being a Hispanic-serving institution and focusing on first-generation students as important characteristics. These audience segments should be examined for particular needs, barriers, or other factors that could influence their interaction with online forms. For example, first-generation students don't always have a family member who understands the mundane details of college attendance like navigating registration requirements. Students whose family members don't read English might also have difficulty getting support to complete complex forms.</p>
        <p>In Houser's discussion of Schriver's three audience analysis methods, he notes that in the intuition-driven method "a writer's experience with audience and texts will result in an improved product because the imagined audience in the writer's head will guide decisions made about the final product." My many years of experience with web development and UNM systems and processes will help guide audience research and  recommendations about the user experience of the Student Forms page. In terms of identifying a shared "personal culture" for such diverse audiences, I could hypothesize that students and/or their helpers value education, and they want to follow rules and solve problems, since they are motivated to understand university regulations and processes and complete a required form to support the student's success (as opposed to ignoring the student's problem or giving up on trying to solve it). This may seem obvious, but the tone of the registrar's pages and forms (and UNM's websites more broadly) is often bureaucratic at best and oppositional at worst, sometimes almost working against audience members instead of with them. Language that is more welcoming, acknowledging the user's desire to comply with university regulations, might create a friendlier, more engaging experience which could even influence the user's opinion of the university as a whole.</p>
        <p>Given that a higher percentage of the audience may be teens, with little to no formal work experience, who may or may not have trusted adults who can provide assistance, a focus on the "lowest level" seems like a good choice. More experienced users can skip the instructions if they don't need them, and simplifying form language and interfaces will help seasoned users as well as novices complete their task successfully without difficulty or additional guidance.</p>
        
        

        <h4>Method</h4>

        <p>I will analyze the design of the forms landing page and the user journey to completing the Demographic Information Change form, and make recommendations for improvements to the design, user experience, language and accessibility of the page and all its linked forms, using the Demographic Information Change form as an example.</p>
